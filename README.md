Obligatory Algorithms Collection
===

In my effort to become better at computer programming and learn ruby. I'm going to start coding up a collection of algorithms and data structures. Realizing this is pretty standard on every GitHub repo, so I'm going to add a test library and write test cases for each algorithm and data structure. I'll try and use as little of the already implemented ruby data structures, for the sake of learning.
